I am a research associate at SVV (Software Verification and Validation) group at SnT, University of Luxembourg. My research interests are mainly related to software mutation testing, model inference, log analysis, and testing for AI.

I received BS, MS, and PhD in computer science in 2010, 2012, and 2018, respectively, from KAIST.
